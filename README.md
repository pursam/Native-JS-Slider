# Native-JS-Slider

## About

On this page, I wanted to create a primitive slider with indication and controls using only a java script without any frameworks.

It has:
- Pressing any button resets the timer for changing the picture, which prevents a second action
- Ability to pause slides
- Transition to any slide of your choice
